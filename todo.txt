Write in the pl/m language
Softare below are sister projects.
See ../projectname for documentation
For the programming languages there
are pdfs of the language refrence
(plm, m80, l80). DO NOT READ DIRECTLY you will loop 
In the path is our uplm80 compiler
In the path is um80 assembler (asseble mac output of uplm80)
In the path is ul80 linker
Not in the path is ../cpmemu/src/cpmemu build
it is linux program that runs cp/m programs and translates
system calls.  If we made 80un.com then running cpmemu 80un.com args to 80un
you could test 80un
All of the above are in github on this accounts.
Note to use the cpm switch to uplm80 to set a normal
cpm stack pointer (under ccp) and org to 100h normal start address
amd call the main proceedure.
see uplm80/examples and uplm80/sample_code
for cp/m programs written in pl/m
Output of this project should be 80un.com and documentation
(command line switches may need to be different)

## Build Instructions for 80un.com

    uplm80 80un.plm -o 80un.mac
    um80 80un.mac
    ul80 -o 80un.com 80un.rel

Test with:
    ~/src/cpmemu/src/cpmemu 80un.com test.lbr

## Target Platform: CP/M 2.2

See ~/src/cpmemu/docs/ for documentation:
- cpm22_bdos_calls.pdf - BDOS function reference
- cpm22_fcb_detailed.pdf - FCB structure
- cpm22_memory_layout.pdf - Memory map
- file_handling_notes.md - File handling details

Key points:
- Files are 128-byte records
- Text files use ^Z (0x1A) as EOF
- FCB at 005CH, DMA buffer at 0080H
- BDOS entry at 0005H
- TPA (program area) starts at 0100H
